### ðŸ‘‹ Emiliano's GitHub Profile ðŸ‘‹

Hey there, my name is Emiliano Arancio. I'm from ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·gentina and I graduated from a bootcamp called "Soy Henry" with some really good projects and experience.

### ðŸ’» Projects ðŸ’»

- [PRO-ROPA](https://github.com/rgzrgzm/e-commerce-pf/): This was my first time working in a team and I'm very happy with its results. PRO-ROPA is a online clothing store made for the Soy Henry bootcamp using React, NodeJS, Express, Sequelize. [You can see the deployed app here](https://pro-ropa-store.vercel.app/)
- [Figurix](https://github.com/Emiliar2002/Figurix): My first approach to javascript for the Coderhouse online course. It's just a simple shopping cart for a (unexistant) action figure store.
- [Selkis Bordados](https://github.com/Emiliar2002/DW-23500-EA): One of the first things I did after learning HTML and CSS. Just a promotional website for a custom emboridery shop.
- [Row Cutter](https://github.com/Emiliar2002/row-cutter): A simple photoshop script to cut and paste same-sized elements in rows.
- [JueguitosDB](https://github.com/Emiliar2002/PI-Videogames-main): Individual project for Soy Henry. It's a web application to find games and informationa about them using an external API (and adding them to the database too.) It was made using React, NodeJS, Express and Sequelize.
